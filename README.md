# D3 Dynamic Filters

This application deploys D3.js and DOM Manipulation to present a dataset of UFOs eye-witness reports collected in January 2010 in the United States and Canada. A JavaScript code allows the user to set one or more filters at the same time (city, date, state, country, and or shape) to search for UFO sightings.
